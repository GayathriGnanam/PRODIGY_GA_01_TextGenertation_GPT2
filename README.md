# PRODIGY_GA_01_TextGenertation_GPT2
This code creates a text generation app using Gradio and GPT-2 from Hugging Face's transformers library. It loads the GPT-2 model and tokenizer, defines a function to generate text completions with beam search, and sets up a Gradio interface for users to input a sentence and receive a coherent continuation. The app provides a simple, interactive way to explore GPT-2's text generation capabilities.
